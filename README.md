This repository is the official implementation of [Neural Laplace Control for Continuous-time Delayed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12604). 

1. Run/Follow steps in [install.sh](setup/install.sh)
2. Replicate experimental results by running and configuring [run_exp_multi.py](run_exp_multi.py).
    ```sh
    python run_exp_multi.py
    ```
3. Process the output log file using [process_logs.py](process_results/process_logs.py) by updating the `LOG_PATH` variable to point to the recently generated log file.
    ```sh
    python process_results/process_logs.py
    ```

#### Retraining
To retrain all models from scratch (much slower), set the following variables to `True` in [run_exp_multi.py](run_exp_multi.py) before running it:
```python
RETRAIN = True
FORCE_RETRAIN = True
```
