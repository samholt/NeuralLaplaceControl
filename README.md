# Neural Laplace Control (Code)

This repo contains the code for the paper "Neural Laplace Control for Continuous-time Delayed Systems"

1. Run/Follow steps in [install.sh](setup/install.sh)
2. Replicate experimental results by running and configuring [run_exp_multi.py](run_exp_multi.py)
3. Process the output log file using [process_logs.py](process_results/process_logs.py) by updating the `LOG_PATH` variable to point to the recently generated log file
